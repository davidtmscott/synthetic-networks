# syntheticnetworks

**syntheticnetworks** is an R package for simulating synthetic spatial networks, particularly useful in ecological or spatial modeling contexts. It provides multiple algorithms for generating patch networks and calculating dispersal-based transition matrices.

## Installation

```r
# From GitHub (if using devtools or remotes)
remotes::install_github("yourusername/syntheticnetworks")
```

## Example 
library(syntheticnetworks)

```r
# Generate a clumpy patch landscape
patches <- generate_clumpy_patches(n.patches = 100, extent = 10, n.clusters = 5)

# Visualize
plot(patches$x, patches$y, main = "Clumpy Patches", pch = 19)

# Create transition matrix
tm <- calculate_transition_matrix(patches, dispersal = 2, R = 1)
```

## Features

- Simulate patch networks with different spatial structures:
  - `generate_uniform_patches()`: Evenly distributed patches across space.
  - `generate_clumpy_patches()`: Patches clustered into groups.
  - `generate_lacy_patches()`: Patches aligned along smoothed contours.
  - `generate_stringy_patches()`: Patches forming elongated or stringy shapes.
- Calculate a transition matrix using:
  - `calculate_transition_matrix()`: Based on Euclidean distances and a dispersal parameter.
- Outputs are standardized as named lists with `x` and `y` coordinates.
