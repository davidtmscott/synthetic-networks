\title{Generate Lacy Habitat Patches}
\usage{
generate_lacy_patches(n.patches, extent, n.foci, l.smooth, n.trials)
}
\arguments{
\item{n.patches}{Integer. Number of habitat patches to return.}

\item{extent}{Numeric. The width and height of the square landscape.}

\item{n.foci}{Integer. Number of influence points (half attract, half repel).}

\item{l.smooth}{Numeric. Smoothing length scale. Smaller values result in more localized effects.}

\item{n.trials}{Integer. Number of candidate patch locations to evaluate.}
}
\value{
A list with two numeric vectors:
\describe{
\item{x}{x-coordinates of selected patches}
\item{y}{y-coordinates of selected patches}
}
}
\description{
Simulates spatially structured habitat patches that cluster near the
zero-contour of a synthetic, smooth landscape. This produces a “lacy” or
corridor-like structure by favoring patch locations where a weighted field
of randomly placed foci cancel each other out.
}
\details{
A large number of candidate patch locations are evaluated based on proximity
to foci. The top-ranked points, where the smoothed opposing influences cancel out,
are retained as patches.
